TextBlade is an early-development text-based JRPG game maker. Some details about TextBlade:

- Create games entirely through JSON, without writing any code! Focus on game design, theme, and content!
- Customize your game by writing C# code to fit your specific requirements!
- Almost everything has audio cues! Add strong audio design to make your game really shine (and really interesting to blind players)!
